# BDD Specifications for Vine Pod

This directory contains Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) specifications written in Gherkin syntax for the Vine Pod Solid Protocol implementation.

## Overview

These specifications define the expected behavior of the Vine Pod service from user perspectives, ensuring compliance with both the Solid Protocol and Linked Data Platform (LDP) specifications.

- Resource metadata and content negotiation

### 2. [Container Management](container-management.feature)
**Tags**: `@R008-R013`
- Container creation and organization
- LDP container type support (Basic, Direct, Indirect)

### 4. [Content Consumer Access](content-consumer.feature)
**Tags**: `@R014-R019`
- Public resource discovery and access
- Format-specific content requests
- Linked data navigation
- Search and filtering capabilities

### 5. [Application Developer Integration](application-developer.feature)
**Tags**: `@R036-R043`
- REST API access and documentation
- Solid-OIDC authentication integration
- Webhook notifications and bulk operations
- SPARQL querying and SDK usage

### 6. [Protocol Compliance](protocol-compliance.feature)
**Tags**: `@solid-compliance`, `@ldp-compliance`
- HTTP method compliance
- Required header support
- CORS and security headers
- WebID authentication and error handling

## Tag Structure

Scenarios are tagged with requirement IDs (e.g., `@R001`) that correspond to the EARS requirements in the `planning/requirements/ears/` directory. Additional tags include:

- `@solid-compliance` - Solid Protocol specific requirements
- `@ldp-compliance` - LDP specification requirements
- `@authentication` - Authentication-related scenarios
- `@access-control` - Permission and access control
- `@performance` - Performance and optimization
- `@security` - Security-related scenarios

## User Perspectives

The specifications are written from the perspective of different user types:

1. **Pod Owner** - Primary user who owns and manages the pod
2. **Content Consumer** - External users accessing public data
3. **Collaborator** - Users with shared access permissions
4. **Application Developer** - Developers integrating with pods
5. **Administrator** - System administrators managing pod infrastructure

## Protocol Compliance Features

### Solid Protocol Requirements
- Solid-OIDC authentication
- WebID-based identity
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
- Linked data notifications
- Privacy and access control

### LDP Requirements
- Container types (Basic, Direct, Indirect)
- Containment and membership triples
- HTTP method semantics
- Link headers and metadata
- Resource creation patterns

## BDD Best Practices Applied

1. **User-Centric Language**: Scenarios written in business-friendly terms
2. **Given-When-Then Structure**: Clear test organization
3. **Scenario Outlines**: Parameterized tests for multiple inputs
4. **Background Steps**: Common setup shared across scenarios
5. **Descriptive Tags**: Organized by requirements and concerns
6. **Real-World Examples**: Concrete data and URIs in scenarios

## Implementation Notes

- Scenarios focus on user behavior, not technical implementation
- Error conditions are tested alongside happy paths
- Edge cases include deep nested paths, bulk operations, and concurrent access
- Security scenarios cover both authentication and authorization
- Performance considerations are included where relevant

## Running the Specifications

These Gherkin specifications are designed to work with Go testing frameworks such as:
- [Godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog) - Official Cucumber implementation for Go
- Custom BDD test runners that can parse Gherkin syntax

Example test execution:
```bash
# Run all scenarios
godog run specs/

# Run specific feature
godog run specs/resource-management.feature

# Run scenarios with specific tags
godog run --tags="@R001,@R002" specs/

# Run protocol compliance tests only
godog run --tags="@solid-compliance" specs/
```

## Contributing

When adding new scenarios:
1. Tag with appropriate requirement IDs
2. Use clear, user-friendly language
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Consider edge cases and error conditions
5. Ensure scenarios are testable and observable
6. Follow the established naming and organization patterns
