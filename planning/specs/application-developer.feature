Feature: Application Developer Integration
  As an application developer
  I want to integrate my application with Solid pods
  So that I can build applications that work with user-controlled data

  Background:
    Given I am developing an application that integrates with Solid pods
    And I have the necessary development tools and credentials

  @R036 @api-access
  Scenario: Access pod functionality via REST API
    Given a Solid pod provides REST API endpoints
    When I make HTTP requests to the API endpoints
    Then I should be able to perform CRUD operations:
      | Operation | HTTP Method | Expected Response |
      | Create    | POST        | 201 Created       |
      | Read      | GET         | 200 OK            |
      | Update    | PUT/PATCH   | 200 OK            |
      | Delete    | DELETE      | 204 No Content    |
    And the API should be well-documented with OpenAPI/Swagger specs
    And error responses should include helpful debug information

  @R037 @authentication-integration
  Scenario: Integrate with Solid-OIDC authentication
    Given my application needs to authenticate users
    When a user wants to connect their Solid pod
    Then I should be able to:
      | Step                      | Action                           |
      | Discover OIDC provider    | Get provider info from WebID     |
      | Initiate auth flow        | Redirect to authorization server |
      | Handle callback          | Process authorization code       |
      | Obtain access token      | Exchange code for token          |
      | Validate user identity   | Verify WebID in token claims     |
    And the authentication should integrate with existing user sessions

  @R038 @webhook-notifications
  Scenario: Receive real-time updates via webhooks
    Given my application processes user data from pods
    When users modify their pod data
    Then the pod should send webhook notifications to my application
    And notifications should include:
      | Information         | Details                          |
      | Event type          | Created, updated, deleted        |
      | Resource URI        | Which resource changed           |
      | Timestamp          | When the change occurred         |
      | User identifier    | Whose data changed               |
    And my application should acknowledge receipt of notifications

  @R039 @bulk-operations
  Scenario: Perform efficient bulk operations
    Given my application needs to process large datasets
    When I need to upload, download, or modify many resources
    Then the pod should provide bulk operation endpoints:
      | Operation              | Endpoint Pattern                 |
      | Bulk upload           | POST /bulk/upload                |
      | Bulk download         | GET /bulk/download?resources=... |
      | Batch modifications   | PATCH /bulk/update               |
    And operations should provide progress information
    And support resumable operations for large datasets

  @R040 @sparql-queries
  Scenario: Query data using SPARQL
    Given a pod contains RDF data across multiple resources
    When I need to find specific data patterns
    Then I should be able to send SPARQL queries:
      """
      SELECT ?person ?name ?email WHERE {
        ?person a foaf:Person ;
                foaf:name ?name ;
                foaf:mbox ?email .
        FILTER(CONTAINS(?name, "Alice"))
      }
      """
    And receive structured results in JSON or XML format
    And the query endpoint should support both read-only and update queries
    And provide query optimization and execution statistics

  @R041 @schema-validation
  Scenario: Validate data against schemas
    Given my application works with structured data
    When I submit data to a pod
    Then I should be able to request schema validation:
      | Schema Type        | Validation Method                |
      | JSON-LD Context   | Validate against @context        |
      | SHACL Shapes      | Validate RDF against shapes      |
      | Custom schemas    | Application-specific validation  |
    And receive detailed validation reports
    And get helpful error messages for invalid data

  @R042 @rate-limiting-awareness
  Scenario: Handle rate limiting in applications
    Given pods implement rate limiting for API access
    When my application makes multiple API requests
    Then I should receive rate limit information:
      | Header                | Usage                            |
      | X-RateLimit-Limit     | Adjust request frequency         |
      | X-RateLimit-Remaining | Decide whether to make requests  |
      | X-RateLimit-Reset     | Schedule retry attempts          |
    And implement exponential backoff for retry logic
    And respect rate limits to maintain good API citizenship

  @R043 @sdk-integration
  Scenario: Use client SDK for rapid development
    Given official SDKs are available for common programming languages
    When I develop applications in different languages:
      | Language   | SDK Features                     |
      | JavaScript | Browser and Node.js support     |
      | Python     | Async/await and sync interfaces  |
      | Java       | Spring Boot integration         |
      | Go         | Idiomatic Go patterns            |
    Then I should be able to perform common operations easily:
      | Operation          | SDK Method                       |
      | Connect to pod     | client.connect(webid, token)    |
      | Read resource      | client.get(uri)                  |
      | Write resource     | client.put(uri, data)            |
      | Query data         | client.query(sparql)             |
    And the SDK should handle authentication, error handling, and retries

  @developer-experience @error-handling
  Scenario: Receive helpful error messages
    Given errors occur during development and testing
    When my application encounters various error conditions
    Then I should receive informative error responses:
      | Error Type              | Information Provided             |
      | Authentication failed   | Reason and next steps            |
      | Permission denied       | Required permissions             |

      | Server error           | Error ID for support             |
    And error messages should include documentation links
    And provide actionable suggestions for resolution

  @development-tools @debugging
  Scenario: Debug application integration
    Given I need to troubleshoot integration issues
    When I enable debug mode in my application
    Then I should be able to:
      | Debug Feature          | Capability                       |
      | Request logging        | See all HTTP requests/responses  |
      | Token inspection       | Validate JWT claims              |
      | Permission checking    | Test access control rules        |
      | Data validation        | Check RDF syntax and semantics   |
    And the pod should provide development-friendly error responses
    And include request/response correlation IDs

  @performance @optimization
  Scenario: Optimize application performance
    Given my application serves many users with pod data
    When I need to optimize performance
    Then I should be able to:
      | Optimization           | Implementation                   |
      | Cache frequently used data | Use ETags and cache headers   |
      | Batch related requests | Use bulk operation endpoints     |
      | Subscribe to changes   | Use webhook notifications        |
      | Minimize data transfer | Request only needed fields       |
    And the pod should support performance best practices
    And provide metrics for monitoring application performance

  @testing @quality-assurance
