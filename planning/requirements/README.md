# EARS Requirements for Vine Pod

This directory contains requirements written using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) methodology for the Vine Pod Linked Data Platform service.

## EARS Syntax

Requirements follow the pattern:
**WHEN** [trigger condition]
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** [system behavior]
**SO THAT** [rationale/benefit]

## User Perspectives

Requirements are organized by user type to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### [REQ-001-007: Pod Owner Resource Management](REQ-001-007-pod-owner-resource-management.md)
Primary users who own and manage their personal data pods - Core CRUD operations on data resources.

### [REQ-008-013: Pod Owner Organization](REQ-008-013-pod-owner-organization.md)
Pod owner capabilities for folder structure and data organization.

### [REQ-014-019: Content Consumer](REQ-014-019-content-consumer.md)
External users who access publicly available resources from pods for their own applications and research.

### [REQ-020-026: Collaborator](REQ-020-026-collaborator.md)
Users who have been granted specific permissions to work with shared resources beyond public access.

### [REQ-027-035: Administrator](REQ-027-035-administrator.md)
System administrators who configure and manage the pod infrastructure, including security, storage, and performance settings.

### [REQ-036-043: Application Developer](REQ-036-043-application-developer.md)
Developers who integrate their applications with the pod platform through APIs and programmatic interfaces.

## Requirements Mapping

| Original Story | User Type | Requirement IDs |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| List resources | Pod Owner, Content Consumer | R001, R014 |
| Create resource | Pod Owner, Collaborator | R002, R021 |
| Create folder | Pod Owner | R008 |
| Delete resources/folders | Pod Owner | R004, R009 |
| Pseudo folders by type | Pod Owner | R011 |
| List folder resources | Pod Owner | R010 |
| Multi-format download | Pod Owner, Content Consumer | R007, R016 |
| External resource linking | Pod Owner | R005 |
| Update resources | Pod Owner, Collaborator | R003, R022 |
| Resource metadata | Pod Owner, Content Consumer | R006, R017 |
| Public access config | Administrator | R027 |
| Storage quotas | Administrator | R028 |
| Content type restrictions | Administrator | R029 |
| Storage backend config | Administrator | R030 |

## Extended Requirements

Requirements marked as "(Extended)" go beyond the original stories to provide comprehensive coverage for each user perspective:

- Collaboration features (R023-R026)
- System monitoring and maintenance (R032-R035)
- Developer integration features (R036-R043)

These extended requirements ensure the platform can grow to meet real-world needs while maintaining the core vision of the original stories.

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize requirements for MVP development
2. Create technical specifications for high-priority requirements
3. Design API contracts based on user interaction requirements
4. Develop test scenarios for requirement validation
